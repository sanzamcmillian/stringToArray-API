# stringToArray-API

Created a server-side API endpoint that will receive a webhook containing a single string of data. The code then converts the string into an array of characters, order the array alphabetically, and return the array as a word.

# Features

This is a simple FastAPI application that exposes a POST API endpoint to receive a webhook containing a string. The string is processed by:

1. Converting it to lowercase
2. Splitting it into characters
3. Sorting the characters alphabetically
4. Returning the sorted characters as a JSON array

# API Endpoints
POST `webhook/sort-word`

Request body:
  ```plaintext
  {
  data: "example"
  }
  ```

Response: 
  ```plaintext
  {
  word: ["a," "e," "e," "l," "m," "p,", "x‚Äù]
  }
  ```
